# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are simply the files (or folders) whose names start with a dot '.' like *.vimrc*, *.bashrc*, *.config*, **etc**. This repository contains my dotfiles for the many different software I use.

## Disclaimer

For those wondering what in the world happened to my previous rice on sway, that can still be found on the 'sway' branch of this repository.
