# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are any files or directories starting with a "." in their name. They are commonly configuration files for software on your computer, such as the ".vimrc" for Vim and ".config", a common directory for software to have their configurations stored. To learn more about dotfiles, I would recommend looking [here](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789).

## Programs

The Programs I Use Are:

- **Sway**\
  I use tiling window managers because they are extensible and minimal, allowing for the perfect rice. I don't want all my RAM to go to animations!
- **Waybar**\
  A sort of taskbar. It can be highly configured and works perfectly with Wayland and setups using Sway WM.
- **Kitty**\
  A highly customizable and extremely fast terminal by offloading rendering to the GPU.
- **ZSH**\
  My favourite shell which I can combine with other software to make even better, such as syntax highlighting and auto command completion.
- **Starship**\
  The prompt for my ZSH config. It is blazing fast and easy to use with other shells as well.
- **LunarVim**\
  A layer on top of Neovim to create a sort of IDE. It is perfect as it is extensible, fast and most importantly, looks good. I use this because it is too hard to keep with Neovim trends, and I am not good at configuring, so I only have to worry about the features I want.
- **Rofi**\
  A run launcher, basically something that allows you to open applications. It is kind of like _dmenu_ but has a lot less hassle in configuration. Config stolen from 'siduck76' and slightly redisigned.
- **Ranger**\
  A terminal file manager. It is pretty simple and allows image previews.
- **Macchina**\
  So have you heard of neofetch? Basically that but better and faster.
